# Getting started with PHP

So far, we've explored amazing areas of the web and built a ton of stuff.
I've seen a lot of amazing games being built, but an overall high score was out of reach... for now.

I'll let you in on a couple of secrets:
1. [The centuries old markdown of PHP basics](./PHP-basics.md)
2. [Installation instructions](./PHP-installation.md)
3. [Best practises, according to... you](./PHP-best-practises.md)
4. I lied in 1, as PHP was released in 1995. Still, just pretend this guide was discovered just now by Indiana Jones.
